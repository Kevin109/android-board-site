## About Android Board

Android Board is a knowledge hub dedicated to ARM-based Android Single Board Computers (SBCs) and their integration into real-world applications.  
We focus on the intersection of **embedded hardware**, **Android OS**, and **display technologies**, providing practical insights for developers, engineers, and product teams.

Our content covers:
- **Board design & customization** — from ARM SoC selection to peripheral integration.
- **Android optimization** — UI tuning, BSP modifications, and performance enhancements.
- **Display solutions** — TFT/IPS displays, touch panels, and optical bonding techniques.
- **Edge computing & IoT** — gateways, HMIs, and smart home devices.

Whether you’re building an industrial control panel, a medical imaging terminal, or a smart home hub, our goal is to help you **reduce development time, improve performance, and ensure long-term maintainability**.  
With decades of combined experience in embedded systems and display manufacturing, we bridge the gap between concept and production, offering both technical depth and actionable guidance.
