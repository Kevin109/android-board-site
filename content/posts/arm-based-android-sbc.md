## 1. What Is an ARM-Based Android SBC?

An **ARM-based Android SBC** is a single circuit board that integrates:
- An ARM processor (often from Rockchip, Allwinner, NXP, or Qualcomm)
- Memory (RAM, flash storage)
- Graphics processing unit (GPU)
- Input/output (I/O) interfaces such as USB, HDMI, GPIO, and serial ports
- Networking capabilities (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, 4G/5G)

Unlike generic SBCs that may run Linux or Windows, these boards run the **Android OS** — offering a familiar, touch-friendly user interface, app-based software ecosystem, and strong multimedia performance.
